CS4032 Lab for creating a server that spins a thread for each new client.

**THIS WILL ONLY WORK ON DEBIAN BASED SYSTEMS**

If you dont have Node.js on your machine run the command `$ ./compile.sh`

This will install node.js and then run the server.

If you've already installed node, then just run the command `node server.js`
